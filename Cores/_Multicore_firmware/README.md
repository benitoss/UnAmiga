# Multicore UnAmiga

Multicore UnAMiga allows to load a core from then SD content. The main core is based in a Multicore of Multicore 2 board of victor Trucco ported  by **Benitoss** to this FPGA.

Multicore UnAmiga operates on two different "firmwares".

The first works on the STM32 microcontroller (_STM32-SPI) and controls the loading of colors, 
while the second (_Multicore) is directly on the flash memory of the FPGA, mounting the initial menu and reading the keyboard and joystick.
